## Description
In this project our group created an application that serves as a mock stock portfolio. The user can create an account, then proceed to select a stock from our curated list to add to their porfolio. Our app keeps track of the price and number of stocks that you purchased in a ledger, so that you can keep track and learn from the investments that you make!
